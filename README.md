Virtual Trading based on strategy in treasury futures and federal rates.


Abstract:
Tresury Futures are inversely proportional to Federal Rates. When rates are being changed, Tresury Futures also changed in opposite direction. Hypothesis for an opportunity is when movements of rates and futures are in same direction for specific period of time then there is an opportunity for the investment/profit (long/short). In this project detection of this hypothesis is developed and then analysis is carried out on day to day basis for 35 years of history.
